## Requirements
Using OOP principles, write a class or series of classes that will elegantly solve the following problem. Attempt to reduce time and space complexity as much as possible and lean into modular programming.

We need a program that can add cars, motorcycles, and vans to a parking lot. The parking lot contains three types of spots: small, medium, and large. A motorcycle can park in any size of spot, a car can park in a medium or large spot, and vans can only park in a large spot.

We need to be able to account for the following:
- Number of available spaces per vehicle type or all vehicle types
- Total number of spots used
- Total number of vehicles by type in the lot
